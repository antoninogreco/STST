# Spatiotemporal Style Transfer (STST)
The STST algorithm is a dynamic visual stimulus generation framework designed for vision research. 
It is based on a two-stream deep neural network model that factorizes spatial and temporal features to generate dynamic visual stimuli whose model layer activations are matched to those of input videos. These generated "model metamers" are dynamic stimuli that can be invariant to content and texture in both the spatial and temporal domain. In general, STST empowers vision scientists to manipulate and synthesize video stimuli for vision research in both biological and artificial systems. For more information, please check the paper!

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies, which are Python >= 3.6, OpenCV >= 4.9.0, TensorFlow >= 2.4:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/antoninogreco/STST
cd STST
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
## Usage
Use the `synthesize.py` file to generate "model metamer" stimuli for object recognition, 
which match the low-level spatiotemporal features of their natural counterparts but lack their high-level semantic features.
``` bash
python synthesize.py -tar "data/Animal"
``` 
This procedure can generate dynamic stimuli like the following. For comparison, there are shown videos generated by randomizing the phase in the spatiotemporal frequency domain (STPS). Check the paper for more information.
